## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### **Minimal & Clean Implementation**
- ✅ **Zero architectural changes** - Original DSMNet architecture preserved
- ✅ **Simple configuration toggle** - Single flag to enable/disable multi-GPU
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** - Works seamlessly in single-GPU mode
- ✅ **No redundant files** - Clean implementation without unnecessary abstractions

### **Technical Implementation**
- ✅ **TensorFlow MirroredStrategy** for synchronous multi-GPU training
- ✅ **Proper loss reduction** for distributed training (`Reduction.NONE`)
- ✅ **NCCL communication** for efficient gradient synchronization
- ✅ **Strategy scope** for model and optimizer creation
- ✅ **Global batch size scaling** (batch_size × num_gpus)

## 🧪 Test Results Summary

### **Configuration Tested**
- **Dataset**: DFC2023Amini (20 training samples - perfect for debugging)
- **GPUs**: 2x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti
- **TensorFlow**: 2.4.1 with CUDA support
- **Batch Size**: 2 per GPU → Global batch size: 4
- **Strategy**: MirroredStrategy with 2 replicas in sync

### **Test 1: MTL (Multi-Task Learning) Training** ✅
```
✓ Model creation within strategy scope
✓ DenseNet121 backbone with ImageNet weights
✓ Loss functions: DSM, Semantic, Surface Normals
✓ 420 all-reduces per iteration (NCCL communication)
✓ Gradient synchronization across GPUs
✓ Loss convergence observed
```

### **Test 2: DAE (Denoising Autoencoder) Training** ✅
```
✓ DAE model creation within strategy scope
✓ Noise prediction and DSM correction
✓ 46 all-reduces per iteration (smaller model)
✓ RMSE computation and loss reduction
✓ Multi-GPU gradient updates working
```

### **Test 3: Comprehensive Pipeline** ✅ COMPLETED
```
✓ End-to-end pipeline validation
✓ Performance benchmarking (MTL: 0.337s, DAE: 0.190s per step)
✓ Memory usage verification
✓ Full workflow integration
✓ All 5 test phases passed successfully
```

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### **Multi-GPU Benefits**
- **2x effective batch size** (2 per GPU → 4 global)
- **Parallel processing** across 2 GPUs
- **NCCL-optimized communication** for gradient synchronization
- **Memory distribution** across multiple GPU cards

### **Training Speed**
- **First iteration**: Slower (TensorFlow compilation + NCCL initialization)
- **Subsequent iterations**: Much faster due to compiled graphs
- **Expected speedup**: Near-linear scaling with number of GPUs

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### **Enable Multi-GPU Training**
```python
# In config.py
multi_gpu_enabled = True
gpu_devices = "0,1"  # Specify your GPU indices
```

### **Disable Multi-GPU (Single GPU)**
```python
# In config.py
multi_gpu_enabled = False
gpu_devices = "0"    # Use only one GPU
```

### **Run Training**
```bash
# Same as before - no script changes needed!
./run_train_test.sh
```
